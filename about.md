## About MADD

Founded by a mother whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver, Mothers Against Drunk Driving® (MADD) is the nation’s largest nonprofit working to protect families from drunk driving, drugged driving and underage drinking. MADD also supports drunk and drugged driving victims and survivors at no charge through local MADD victim advocates and our 24-Hour Victim Helpline 1-877-MADD-HELP (1-877-6899-4951).

## Our Mission

MADD was incorporated on September 5, 1980, the mission or purposes of MADD as stated in its Articles of Incorporation were “To aid the victims of crimes performed by individuals driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, to aid the families of such victims and to increase public awareness of the problem of drinking and drugged driving.”

**MADD’s mission has since been updated. Today, MADD’s mission is “To end drunk driving, help fight drugged driving, support the victims of these violent crimes, and prevent underage drinking.”**
